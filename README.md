# Modular Carry Look-ahead Adder
This design is intended for implementation of FPGAs. An Artix-7 chip is used as reference with Xilinx Vivado. The CLA is developed at a structural level of abstraction because it is combinational by design.
The data width is defined by parameter statements in the Verilog HDL. The report showcases an 8-bit implementation.
